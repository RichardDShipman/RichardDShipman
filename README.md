## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<!--
**RichardDShipman/RichardDShipman** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

I am a bioinformatician with a background in applied science, with a concentration in biochemistry and molecular biology. Throughout my life, Iâ€™ve been tinkering with computers, which naturally led me to support the projects I pursue. Past experiences involved developing computational proteomics tools that enable the discovery and application of novel phosphopeptides and glycopeptides with desired properties.  I am currently enrolled as a Master student in Omics Data Analysis at the University of Vic - Central University of Catalonia (UVic-UCC). I enjoy exploring the intersection of different omics fields with the aid of computational tools. For my Final Master's Project, I am researching at the University of Valencia on the glycovirology of rotaviruses. The projects listed below highlight some of those adventures.

# Recent Projects

Here is a list of recent projects I have been toying with on my free time.

1. Glycopeptide Sequence Finder 
- A script for hunting (protease-digested) N/O/C-linked glycopeptides in protein/proteome FASTA files based on sequon (motif). It includes a library of digested glycopeptides from various model organisms, common livestock & crops, sea critters and a host of fungus & viral pathogens. [Glycopeptide_Sequence_Finder](https://github.com/RichardDShipman/Glycopeptide_Sequence_Finder)
2. Glycoproteomics Graph Tool 
- Neo4j based graph knowledge base for storing glycoproteomics records in context to the central dogma of molecular biology. [Glycoproteomics_Graph_Tool](https://github.com/RichardDShipman/Glycoproteomics_Graph_Tool)
3.  Glycopeptide Proteoform Generator 
- A script to generate proteoforms by reading glycopeptide data from a CSV file, with limits on the number of proteoforms, saving results in both CSV and text file formats for each protein. [Glycopeptide_Proteoform_Generator](https://github.com/RichardDShipman/Glycopeptide_Proteoform_Generator)

# Past Projects

Here is a list of past projects I have worked on, with links to related GitHub repositories if they are available. 

1.	Glycoproteomics Knowledge Database Development 
- Developed a Neo4j graph database for glycomics, integrating public multi-omics data.
2.	Glycoproteomics Mass Spectrometry Deep Learning Pipeline
